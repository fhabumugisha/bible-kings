Task 09 : FilterBar and Home Page Assembly

Build the filter bar component and assemble the complete home page by combining Header (in layout), Hero, FilterBar, and CardGrid with state management for filtering.

CONTEXT FROM THE PRD

The home page is the main view of the application. It shows the hero section at the top, then a filter bar, then the card grid with all 43 kings. The filter bar lets users filter by era (Tous/Monarchie Unie/Israel/Juda), by faithfulness level (Tous/Fideles/Infideles), and search by name. Filtering changes which cards are visible in the grid.

WHAT TO BUILD

1. Create src/components/FilterBar.tsx as a client component ('use client').

   Props:
   selectedEra: Kingdom or 'all'
   selectedFaithfulness: 'all' or 'faithful' or 'unfaithful'
   searchQuery: string
   onEraChange: callback receiving Kingdom or 'all'
   onFaithfulnessChange: callback receiving 'all', 'faithful', or 'unfaithful'
   onSearchChange: callback receiving string

   Layout:
   A horizontal bar with three filter controls, wrapping on mobile.
   Era filter: a set of pill buttons or a dropdown. Options: "Tous", "Monarchie Unie", "Israel (Nord)", "Juda (Sud)". The active option is visually highlighted with the corresponding era color.
   Faithfulness filter: a dropdown or pill buttons. Options: "Tous", "Fideles (4+ etoiles)", "Infideles (2- etoiles)".
   Search: a text input with a magnifying glass icon and placeholder "Rechercher un roi...". Filters as the user types (no submit button needed).
   Style: subtle background (parchment-100), rounded corners, consistent with the parchment/biblical aesthetic.

2. Modify src/app/layout.tsx to include the Header component. The Header should appear on every page, so it belongs in the root layout, rendered above the {children}.

3. Create/modify src/app/page.tsx as the home page.

   This is the main page component. It can be a client component since it manages filter state.

   State:
   selectedEra (default 'all')
   selectedFaithfulness (default 'all')
   searchQuery (default empty string)

   Filtering logic:
   Start with the full KINGS array from data/kings.ts.
   If selectedEra is not 'all', filter to kings where kingdom matches.
   If selectedFaithfulness is 'faithful', keep kings with faithfulness >= 4. If 'unfaithful', keep kings with faithfulness <= 2.
   If searchQuery is not empty, keep kings whose name contains the search string (case insensitive).
   Pass the filtered array to CardGrid.

   Rendering order:
   Hero component
   FilterBar component (with filter state and callbacks)
   CardGrid component (with filtered kings and ERAS)
   Give the CardGrid section an id (like "card-grid") so the Hero's "Explorer les cartes" button can scroll to it.

   QuizModal integration:
   Manage a state for which king's quiz is currently open (kingId or null).
   When a card's quiz button is clicked, set this state to the king's ID.
   Render the QuizModal component conditionally when a kingId is set. Since QuizModal is built in task 11, for now just add the state management and pass a placeholder or skip the modal rendering. Add a comment indicating where the QuizModal will be integrated.

DEPENDENCIES

Task 07 (CardGrid), Task 08 (Header and Hero), Task 03 (KINGS and ERAS data).

WHAT OTHER TASKS NEED FROM THIS

Task 11 (QuizModal) will be integrated into this page's rendering.
Task 13 (Polish) may refine the page layout.

SUCCESS CRITERIA

The home page renders correctly with Hero at top, FilterBar below it, and CardGrid with all 43 cards.
The Header appears at the top of the page (from the layout) and stays sticky on scroll.
Selecting "Israel (Nord)" in the era filter shows only the 19 northern kingdom cards.
Selecting "Fideles" shows only kings with faithfulness 4 or 5.
Typing "david" in the search field shows only the David card.
Combining filters works (for example era "Juda" plus faithfulness "Fideles" shows Asa, Josaphat, Ozias, Jotham, Ezechias, Josias).
Clearing all filters shows all 43 cards again.
The page is responsive and looks good on mobile (1 column) through large desktop (4 columns).
npm run build produces no errors.
