Task 07 : CardGrid with Era Sections

Build the CardGrid component that displays all 43 king cards organized into 3 era sections with headers, using a responsive grid layout. This also includes the era section header subcomponent.

CONTEXT FROM THE PRD

The cards are grouped into 3 sections: Monarchie Unie (3 cards, gold), Royaume du Nord Israel (19 cards, red), and Royaume du Sud Juda (21 cards, blue). Each section has a decorative header showing the era name, description, king count, and a colored band. The grid is responsive: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on small desktop, 4 on large desktop.

WHAT TO BUILD

Create src/components/CardGrid.tsx. This can be a server component or client component depending on whether it needs to handle filtering (filtering state comes from the parent page, so it can receive filtered data as props).

Props: kings (King array, possibly filtered), eras (Era array)

1. Era Section Header (can be inline or a separate small component):
   For each era, render a header block containing:
   The era name in Cinzel font, large size (like text-2xl).
   The era description in Inter font, smaller and muted color.
   The king count (like "3 rois" or "19 rois").
   The date range from the era data.
   A decorative colored band/line at the top or left of the header, using the era's color (gold, red, or blue).
   Use appropriate emojis: crown for united, sword for Israel, temple for Juda (matching the wireframe).

2. Grid layout:
   Each era section contains a CSS grid of KingCard components.
   Responsive breakpoints using Tailwind:
   Below 640px: 1 column, gap 24px, padding 16px
   640px to 1023px: 2 columns, gap 24px, padding 24px
   1024px to 1279px: 3 columns, gap 32px, padding 32px
   1280px and above: 4 columns, gap 32px, padding 48px
   Cards are centered within each grid cell.

3. Rendering:
   Iterate over ERAS. For each era, filter the kings array to get only kings matching that era's kingdom.
   If the filtered result for an era is empty (due to filtering), skip rendering that era section entirely.
   For each king in the filtered era group, render a KingCard.
   Each KingCard gets an id attribute set to the king's ID so that parallel king links can scroll to it.

4. Parallel king scroll behavior:
   The onParallelKingClick callback for each KingCard should scroll smoothly to the target card's element. Use document.getElementById(parallelKingId) and scrollIntoView with behavior 'smooth' and block 'center'.

5. Quiz click behavior:
   The onQuizClick callback for each KingCard should open the QuizModal for that specific king. For now, since the QuizModal is built in task 11, just pass a placeholder callback or lift the state up to the page component that will handle it. The callback should receive the king's ID.

DEPENDENCIES

Task 06 (KingCard), Task 03 (KINGS and ERAS data), Task 02 (types).

WHAT OTHER TASKS NEED FROM THIS

Task 09 (Home Page Assembly) renders CardGrid as the main content area.

SUCCESS CRITERIA

CardGrid renders all 43 cards organized into 3 sections with visible era headers.
Each era section header shows the era name, description, count, dates, and colored decoration.
The grid is responsive: visually verify 1 column on narrow viewport, 2 on medium, 3 on desktop, 4 on large.
Clicking a parallel king link on any card back scrolls smoothly to the correct king's card.
Each era section only renders if it has kings to show (handles filtering gracefully).
Each card element has an id attribute matching the king's ID.
npm run build produces no errors.
